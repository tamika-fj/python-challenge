Module 3  Python Challenge. In this repositry I have uploaded a folder called python challenge, within this folder there are two subfolders, one for PyBank and PyPoll. These folders contain the resource files used, the python code files that solved the activities and the .cvs files with the solutions. The python codes are annotated for ease of reading and understanding.
To create the code I adapted code from class activities and lectures. Addotionally I watched a youtube video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5uM4VKywbA&ab_channel=CoreySchafer to help with writing the .cvs file. Using the /t helped with a problem I was having with commas writing to my .cvs file.
